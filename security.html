                    <img src="IMAGES/vpn.png">
                    <p>Anyone on the internet can benefit from a VPN. The term stands for Virtual Private Network, and
                        it's another layer of security masking your online activity from third parties. It's most useful
                        when you are connecting to any public internet connection, like a coffee shop or an Airbnb. With
                        a VPN, your new, secured connection will separate the hacker from the data that they are hoping
                        to steal.

                    <h1>2. Reliable Antivirus Software</h1>
                    <img src="IMAGES/antivirus.webp">
                    <p>A good, reliable antivirus program is a basic must-have of any cyber security system. Apart from
                        that, anti-malware software is also an essential. They work as the final frontier for defending
                        unwanted attacks, should they get through your security network.They work by detecting and
                        removing virus and malware, adware and spyware. They also filter out potentially harmful
                        downloads and emails.

                    <h1>3. Use Complex Passwords</h1>
                    <img src="IMAGES/password.png">
                    <p>Almost every computer and Web-based application requires a key for accessing it. Whether it is
                        the answers to security questions or the passwords, make sure you create complex ones to make it
                        difficult for hackers to crack them. Using space before and/or after your passwords is also a
                        good idea to throw the hacker off.
                    </p>

                    <h1>4. Install Encryption Software</h1>
                    <img src="IMAGES/encryption.png">
                    <p>If you deal with data pertaining to credit cards, bank accounts, and social security numbers on a
                        daily basis, it makes sense to have an encryption program in place. Encryption keeps data safe
                        by altering information on the computer into unreadable codes. Even if your data does get
                        stolen, it would be useless to the hacker.

                    <h1>5. Protect with a Firewall</h1>
                    <img src="IMAGES/firewall.gif">
                    <p>A firewall works by blocking or deterring viruses from entering your network, while an antivirus
                        works by targeting the software affected by a virus that has already gotten through. They work
                        well together, in other words. Putting up a firewall aids in protecting a small business's
                        network traffic. It can stop hackers from attacking your network by blocking certain websites.
                    </p>

                    <h1>6. Secure Your Wi-Fi Network</h1>
                    <img src="IMAGES/wifi.jpg">
                    <p>Say goodbye to the WEP network if you still use it and switch to WPA2 instead as the latter is
                        much more secure. WPA2 is an increasingly common standard for online security, so there's a good
                        chance you're already using it. Also to protect your Wi-Fi network from breaches by hackers,
                        change the name of your wireless access point or router.

                    <img src="IMAGES/accessdata.png">
                    <p>Keep the number of people with access to critical data to a minimum, never share your personal
                        information with someone else on social media or the Internet. This will minimize the chances of
                        a data leak.

                    <img src="IMAGES/laptop.jpg">
                    <p>Because of the ease of carrying them around, laptops and smartphones hold a hell of a lot of
                        valuable data, and that is also the reason they are at a higher risk of getting lost or stolen.
                        Make sure that they have a good securty system in place with appropriate back ups.
                    </p>

                <div class="box3">
                    <h1>9. Back Up Data Often</h1>
                    <img src="IMAGES/backup.jpg">
                    <p>Either manually back up all data to an external hard drive or the cloud, or simply schedule
                        automated backups to ensure that your information is stored safely. That way, even if your
                        systems are compromised, you still have your information safe with you. This ensures that no
                        single point of failure can erase months or years of historical data.
                    </p>

                <div class="box3">
                    <h1>10. Ignore Suspicious Emails</h1>
                    <img src="IMAGES/email.png">
                    <p>Make it a habit to never open or reply to suspicious-looking emails, even if they appear to be
                        from a known sender. Even if you do open the email, do not click on suspicious links or download
                        attachments. Doing so may make you a victim of online financial and identity theft through a
                        “phishing” scam</p>

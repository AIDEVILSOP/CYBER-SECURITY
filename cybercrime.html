                    <br><br>A cybercriminal may use a device to access a user’s personal information, confidential
                    business information, government information, or disable a device.

                    <img src="IMAGES/ddos.png">
                    <p>These are used to make an online service unavailable and take the network down by overwhelming
                        the site with traffic from a variety of sources. Large networks of infected devices known as
                        Botnets are created by depositing malware on users’ computers. The hacker then hacks into the
                        system once the network is down.</p>

                    <p>PUPS or Potentially Unwanted Programs are less threatening than other cybercrimes, but are a type
                        of malware. They uninstall necessary software in your system including search engines and
                        pre-downloaded apps. They can include spyware or adware, so it’s a good idea to install an
                        antivirus software to avoid the malicious download.

                    <p>This cybercrime occurs when a criminal gains access to a user’s personal information; to steal

                        retrieving information from social media, or sending phishing emails. They can also open a false
                        phone/internet account in your name to fulfill personal gains.

                        online messages and emails. Typically cyberstalkers use social media, websites and search
                        engines to intimidate a user and instill fear. Usually, the cyberstalker knows their victim and
                        makes the person feel afraid or concerned for their safety.

                        the necessary information needed. Once they gain access to an account, they can sell your
                        information or secure accounts in your name.

                        their password or update their billing information, giving criminals access.
